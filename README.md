# IACRF
This is a fork of the IACRF page. Additions to the original code base include automated testing of several training datasets, derived from supplementary data in the original paper Available on Open Access from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-022-00295-5 . Additional improvements, hyperparameter search, more verbose error logging, additions of percent difference error calculation, and attempts at linearizing data by taking the logarithmic of the corrosion rate

Original Readme: Here, we propose a novel strategy __Integrating _Ab-initio_ Calculations with Random Forest__ (IACRF) to optimize the RF model, thereby estimating the corrosion rate of Al alloys in diverse environments. Based on the thermodynamic assessment of the secondary phases, the ab-initio calculation quantities, especially the work function, significantly improved the prediction accuracy with respect to small-sample Al alloys corrosion dataset.
